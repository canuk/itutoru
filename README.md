This is a sample app in response to the following Task given in a Job Interview Follow-up for the Stanford GSE:

A few weeks after the generative AI seed grantees are announced, a project lead asks for a meeting. He is exploring ways to improve learners’ comprehension by having them teach AI agents.

In the population he is addressing, learners are not scoring well on science exams. He wants to use an AI agent as a way for students to explain concepts and then refine, over time, their own comprehension by noting what they do and don’t understand via the process of explaining concepts to others. 

He and his team are considering building off of the APIs for ChatGPT, GPT-3, or upcoming options like Bard. They are also considering non-API solutions like Chatbase. They would like to have a prototype to do light user testing with in 3 months, and potentially expand to a broader user testing base in 5 months.
